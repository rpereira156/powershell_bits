# Run in PowerShell 7
# If the error "New-MailContact: Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Name' because it is an empty string." pops up, check the .csv. Excel added semicolons instead of just commas
# Check the data provided by the user beforehand
# The .csv file should be formatted with at least two fields: ExternalEmailAddress,Name
# Use the email address for both fields, since most of the emails to be blocked are marketing emails should as info@company.com, marketing@info.com, noreply@info.com. Otherwise you will have to come up with unique names to each contact.
